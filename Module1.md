### **Module 1 Assignment**

##### What I learned

In the first part of the module 1 assignment, we learned about GitHub repositories, cloning/forking, committing/pushing, branches, issues, readme files, and more. I look forwards to gaining a deeper understanding of Git and Github throughout this course!
