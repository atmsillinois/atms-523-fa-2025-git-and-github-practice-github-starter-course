## Step 2 - what I'm confused about


Here are a few things I'm confused about with Git, Github, and specifically how we're using it in this class:
* I'm familiar with git as I use it at work every day, mainly through GitLab and the terminal. I'm comfortable with git comands through the terminal, but its implementation in an IDE like VS code is a bit more confusing to me.
* At work, I've tried to resolve merge conflicts through VS code and end up making even more of a mess than when I started
* The github classroom interface confuses me a lot. I'm not used to fully creating a new repository - usually I'm just cloning someone else's repo, editing a file, adding and committing my changes, pushing the changes, and creating a merge request. I'm interested to learn this new classroom interface.
