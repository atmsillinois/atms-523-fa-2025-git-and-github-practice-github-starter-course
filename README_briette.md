This is my markdown file for part of this Module 1 assignment.

I have many questions and am still trying to understand how to use github. I feel like I understand the point and the 
general/conceptual workflow, but I don't understand how to actually do anything! The only file type I think I 
understand is markdown. I'm sure we will learn in this class! :)
