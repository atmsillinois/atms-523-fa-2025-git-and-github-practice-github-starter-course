## Markdown file on my learning outcomes and challenges
I am now familiar with the idea of "forking" someone else's repository to allow me to more easily edit the entire project, instead of a snippet or feature of the repository with a branch.

However, I am still confused about the pull request and what is its exact purpose. I was unable to use it on this current repository.
